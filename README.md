# Kuka Robot Maze Challenge

## Overview

This repository is home to the Kuka Robot Maze Challenge, a project designed to simulate an autonomous robotic navigation challenge within a virtual environment provided by Webots.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following software installed:
- **Python 3.10:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Webots 2023 (IDE):** [Download Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/#download)

## Project Description

### The Challenge

A Kuka robot is programmed to autonomously navigate from a starting point, tracing a black line to a maze's entrance. Critical to its journey, the robot will encounter a uniquely colored box that it must identify and commit to memory - this color is the key to the maze's puzzle.

### Inside the Maze

Once it enters the labyrinth, the robot's goal is to systematically collect all the boxes, except those matching the memorized color. These boxes are to be transported on its back as it weaves through the maze's intricacies.

### Navigation Strategy

The robot is equipped with algorithms to avoid no-exit traps and repetitive loops, conserving its energy and optimizing its path to success.

### The Finale

Upon collecting all the required boxes, the robot heads to the final checkpoint. Here, it releases its cargo, signaling the end of the challenge.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Kuka Robot Maze Challenge:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required software (Python 3.10, Webots 2023).
3. Run the simulation within Webots.

Stay tuned for updates as the robot's algorithms and the maze complexity evolve.
